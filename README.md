# Unofficial Documentation for Advanced Custom Fields Extended

The [Advanced Custom Fields Extended](https://www.acf-extended.com/) 
([Github Repo](https://github.com/acf-extended/ACF-Extended)) plugin is extremely userful
and quite powerful, but its documentation is a bit sparse. This repository is a home for
an unofficial Wiki documenting useful information about the plugin, particularly from
a developer's perspective.
